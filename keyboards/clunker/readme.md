# Required Tools

These tools and components are required to complete the project and are not included in the kit. The linked names of the components will generally link to a place where you can buy them.

Soldering Iron
Preferably a medium or small tip to make soldering the components easier.
Solder Wire
 I recommend a thinner 63/37 rosin core solder wire. In this build I am using Kester Solder 63/37 .015 Dia. 
 Flush Cutters (THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY IN THIS GUIDE IN PARTICULAR)
Small Phillips Head Screwdriver

The Big Stuff
PCB

Bottom

Plate
(if your purchased one)

Components
Blackpill

Diodes (75)

LEDs and 220 Ohm Resistors

EEPROM and 10k Ohm Resistors
Note: The base kit no longer includes EEPROM or resistors for the EEPROM. The base firmware now supports EEPROM emulation. If you would like to add the EEPROM on, please select the option for it when ordering.
