# Required Tools
<a id="required">
These tools and components are required to complete the project and are not included in the kit. The linked names of the components will generally link to a place where you can buy them.

Soldering Iron
Preferably a medium or small tip to make soldering the components easier.
Solder Wire
 I recommend a thinner 63/37 rosin core solder wire. In this build I am using Kester Solder 63/37 .015 Dia. 
 Flush Cutters (THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY IN THIS GUIDE IN PARTICULAR)
Small Phillips Head Screwdriver
