# Required Tools

These tools and components are required to complete the project and are not included in the kit. The linked names of the components will generally link to a place where you can buy them.

- [Soldering Iron](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=soldering+iron)
    - Preferably a medium or small tip to make soldering the components easier.
- [Solder Wire](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=solder+wire+63%2F37+rosin+core)
    - I recommend a thinner 63/37 rosin core solder wire. In this build I am using [Kester Solder 63/37 .015 Dia](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X4L076).
- [Flush Cutters](https://mechwild.com/product/flush-cutters/)
- [Small Phillips Head Screwdriver](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=screwdriver+kit)
