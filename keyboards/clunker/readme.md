# Required Tools

These tools and components are required to complete the project and are not included in the kit. The linked names of the components will generally link to a place where you can buy them.

-Soldering Iron
-Preferably a medium or small tip to make soldering the components easier.
-Solder Wire
    -I recommend a thinner 63/37 rosin core solder wire. In this build I am using Kester Solder 63/37 .015 Dia. 
    -Flush Cutters (THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY IN THIS GUIDE IN PARTICULAR)
-Small Phillips Head Screwdriver
